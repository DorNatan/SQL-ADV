# SQL-ADV
This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and projects from the Advanced SQL course I completed on Udemy.
The course covered advanced SQL topics such as:

Window Functions (e.g., RANK, LEAD, LAG)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Subqueries and Nested Queries

Advanced JOIN techniques

Aggregations and Grouping Sets

Performance tuning and indexing strategies

Working with real-world datasets

The repository is organized by topic and includes code snippets, practice queries, and solutions to various challenges presented throughout the course.
